# Hi, I'm template bones

I'm a happy little skeleton. You can clone me to use as a starter on your UI/UX front-end projects with no database!
I have React, Redux, and Express all just rattling around in here ready to go.

## I need node >= 6.7.0

If you don't have it, I'll complain and tell you how to install it.

## 1. Make me into something!

We recommend that you **clone**, not fork, this repo â€“ unless your intention is
to develop Bones proper instead of using Bones as the starting point for your
own application.

Start by doing either of the following:

## 1. I need a name.

I don't have a name. I think I used to have one, but it turned to dust right along with my
heart and liver and pituitary gland and all that stuff.

Anyway, I'll need one. Give me a name in `package.json`.

## 2. Start my dusty heart

Short and sweet:

```sh
npm install
```

```sh
npm run start-dev
```

```sh
npm run build-dev
```
